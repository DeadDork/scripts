# Usage:

#	./match-n-mark.sh MATCH_FIELD MATCH_PREFIX SOURCE_MATCH_FILE TARGET_MATCH_FILE

# That is, if you want to mark with the prefix '*' all entries from file B that, in their second field, have a match in file A, then enter:

#	./match-n-mark.sh '$2' '*' A B

# This will output all lines from file B, and those lines that have in the second field a match from file A will be marked with '*' at the start of the output row.
